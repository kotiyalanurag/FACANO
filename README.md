<p align = left>Using mediapipe for face detection and anonymizing faces using basic opencv blur.</p>

## Overview

FACANO is capable of detecting and anonymizing faces in three different modes i.e., static images, videos, and live webcam feed. It can detect and anonymize multiple faces at once.

## How to get started?

Open the terminal on your mac and type 
```html
mkdir FACANO
```
Then switch to the new directory using
```html
cd FACANO
```
Now clone the repository on your local machine using
```html
git clone https://github.com/kotiyalanurag/FACANO.git
```
Now create a virtual environment using (assuming you have python installed on your machine)
```html
python -m venv env
```
Switch to your new virtual environment using
```html
source env/bin/activate
```
Now install the requirements for this project using
```html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Have fun playing around with the code.
